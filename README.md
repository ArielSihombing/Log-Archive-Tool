# 🧰 Log Archive Tool

This project is a simple automation tool for compressing and archiving system log files in Linux using Python.
It helps organize and clean up log directories by automatically creating compressed archives.

## 🚀 How It Works
- Scans the `/var/log` directory (or any directory you specify).
- Compresses `.log` files into a `.tar.gz` archive. 
- Moves the archive to a target backup folder.

## 🧩 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Linux-based system (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Kali)
